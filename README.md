# Game code for Unity pet project!

Here are some of the C# files from my Unity game.
This was essentially just a fun new pet project I decided to make using online tutorials and guides. It's a very simple open-world game, players can move, jump, sit, dance, and interact with objects.
The assets in the game were also all made by myself using Blender!
